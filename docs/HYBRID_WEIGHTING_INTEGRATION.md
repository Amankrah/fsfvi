# Hybrid Weighting Integration for FSFVI System

## Overview

This document describes the successful integration of the hybrid weighting methodology into the FSFVI (Food System Financing Vulnerability Index) system. The integration streamlines the codebase while providing multiple sophisticated weighting methods that capture true component importance beyond simple financial allocation patterns.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Streamlined Architecture

**Before:**
- Duplicate calculator implementations (`EnhancedFSFVICalculator` in `main.py`)
- Conditional advanced weighting in `data_preparation.py`
- Inconsistent weighting application
- Complex import dependencies

**After:**
- Single `StreamlinedFSFVICalculator` with integrated hybrid weighting
- `UnifiedFSFVICalculator` for API compatibility
- Clean separation of concerns
- Simplified import structure

### 2. Integrated Weighting Methods

The system now supports four weighting methodologies:

#### Financial Weighting (Original)
- **Description:** Weights based on current financial allocations
- **Use Case:** Budget-constrained analysis, resource allocation review
- **Advantages:** Reflects current resource distribution, simple to understand

#### Expert-Driven Weighting
- **Description:** Weights based on expert consensus and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)
- **Use Case:** Strategic planning, policy development, crisis scenarios
- **Features:**
  - Expert consensus weights from food system literature
  - AHP pairwise comparison matrix
  - Scenario-adjusted weights for different stress conditions

#### Network Centrality Weighting
- **Description:** Weights based on component interdependencies and cascade effects
- **Use Case:** Risk assessment, system resilience, infrastructure planning
- **Features:**
  - PageRank centrality analysis
  - Eigenvector centrality calculation
  - Cascade multiplier analysis for failure propagation

#### Hybrid Weighting (Recommended)
- **Description:** Integrated approach combining expert knowledge, network effects, and financial reality
- **Formula:** `0.4 × expert + 0.3 × pagerank + 0.2 × cascade + 0.1 × financial`
- **Use Case:** General analysis, comprehensive assessment, multi-stakeholder contexts
- **Features:**
  - Performance-adjusted weights
  - Context-aware scenario adaptations
  - Balanced methodology

### 3. Scenario-Based Adaptations

The system adapts weights based on operating scenarios:

- **Normal Operations:** Standard weight distribution
- **Climate Shock:** Climate/natural resources components get higher priority
- **Financial Crisis:** Agricultural development and social assistance prioritized
- **Pandemic Disruption:** Nutrition/health components emphasized

### 4. Enhanced API Endpoints

All endpoints now support hybrid weighting with query parameters:

```bash
# Calculate FSFVI with hybrid weighting
POST /calculate_fsfvi?weighting_method=hybrid&scenario=normal_operations

# Optimize allocation with expert weighting for climate shock
POST /optimize_allocation?weighting_method=expert&scenario=climate_shock

# Simulate shock with network-based weighting
POST /simulate_shock?weighting_method=network&scenario=normal_operations

# Compare different weighting methods
GET /compare_weighting_methods?scenario=normal_operations

# Get information about available methods
GET /weighting_methods
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic FSFVI Calculation with Hybrid Weighting

```python
# Python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8001/calculate_fsfvi?weighting_method=hybrid&scenario=normal_operations",
    json={
        "food_system_id": "fs-001",
        "food_system_name": "National Food System",
        "fiscal_year": 2024,
        "total_budget": 1000.0,
        "components": [...]
    }
)
```

```bash
# cURL
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8001/calculate_fsfvi?weighting_method=hybrid&scenario=climate_shock" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"food_system_id": "fs-001", ...}'
```

### Compare Weighting Methods

```python
import json
import requests

components_json = json.dumps(components_data)
response = requests.get(
    f"http://localhost:8001/compare_weighting_methods?scenario=normal_operations",
    params={'components_json': components_json}
)

comparison = response.json()
for method, data in comparison['comparison'].items():
    print(f"{method}: FSFVI = {data['fsfvi_value']:.6f}")
```

### Optimization with Expert Weighting for Crisis Scenario

```python
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8001/optimize_allocation?weighting_method=expert&scenario=financial_crisis",
    json=request_data
